# Lobster Encounters

## Status

- Product status: Draft
- PRD date: July 17, 2026
- Implementation status: Blocked
- Blocking prerequisite: Replace, validate, deploy, and approve the complete fish
  slap artwork library
- Source of truth: This document
- Delivery rule: Do not implement `/lobster`, create its schema, provision its
  production storage, or generate its production artwork until the blocking
  prerequisite is complete

## Summary

Add a guild-only `/lobster` command and `Release Lobster` user command to Hermit.
An authorized staff member selects a target, Hermit deploys one scientifically
recognized marine lobster species, and the target receives an interactive,
species-specific encounter.

The feature must represent every accepted, extant marine lobster species in the
frozen production taxonomy. Artwork must reflect each species' anatomy and may
use pinching, antenna strikes, tail-powered escapes, body checks, ambushes,
refusals, ceremonial appearances, or other species-appropriate behavior.

This is not a lobster-themed copy of `/slap`. It is a larger visual anthology
with materially different settings, media, compositions, casts, moods, and
actions.

## Background

Hermit's current fish slap feature uses a fixed fish-by-outcome scene matrix.
Although the scene count is large, its first artwork generation pass repeated a
narrow visual grammar: adult men, office or hearing-room interiors, similar
camera angles, and polished photorealistic action stills.

The lobster feature must not repeat that failure at a larger scale. Diversity
must be encoded in catalog metadata, generation manifests, quotas, and review
gates before production generation starts.

The 2019 *Updated Checklist of the World's Marine Lobsters* recognized 260
species across six families. The production count may differ because taxonomy
continues to change. Hermit will therefore use a dated, checksummed World
Register of Marine Species snapshot rather than a hardcoded historical count.

## Goals

1. Represent every species in the approved frozen marine lobster taxonomy.
2. Make anatomy and species identity materially affect each encounter.
3. Produce at least four approved, visibly distinct scenes per species.
4. Provide strong variation in medium, tone, environment, composition, palette,
   lighting, action, and adult cast.
5. Give the named target one durable, target-only response to the encounter.
6. Share cooldown enforcement with `/slap` so the commands cannot bypass one
   another.
7. Store production artwork outside Git history in dedicated public object
   storage.
8. Keep command execution deterministic, durable, idempotent, and guild-only.
9. Use Carbon components v2 for every Discord response and incident card.
10. Make taxonomy and artwork refreshes versioned and reproducible.

## Non-Goals

- Implementing or generating the feature before slap artwork remediation is
  approved.
- Treating every common name containing "lobster" as an included species.
- Including squat lobsters, freshwater crayfish, fossils, extinct species,
  synonyms, or subspecies in v1.
- Querying WoRMS during a Discord interaction.
- Giving every species an identical outcome matrix.
- Generating artwork from Discord avatars or attempting to depict real users.
- Allowing user installs, direct messages, or use outside the configured guild.
- Building a backoffice UI.
- Storing the production image corpus in the Git repository.
- Reusing the existing private ClawHub case-file bucket for public artwork.

## Taxonomy

### Included Families

The initial catalog covers accepted extant marine species in these six lobster
families:

1. Nephropidae
2. Enoplometopidae
3. Glypheidae
4. Palinuridae
5. Scyllaridae
6. Polychelidae

### Inclusion Rules

A catalog record is included only when the frozen WoRMS snapshot reports:

- Taxonomic rank exactly equal to `Species`.
- Accepted taxonomic status.
- Marine status.
- Extant status.
- Membership in one of the six approved families.

Synonyms resolve to the accepted species and do not receive separate selection
weight or artwork. Subspecies, fossils, extinct records, freshwater-only
records, brackish-only records, and unaccepted names are excluded.

### Snapshot Requirements

The taxonomy build must persist:

- Snapshot identifier and UTC creation timestamp.
- WoRMS AphiaID.
- Accepted scientific name and authority.
- Family, genus, and species classification.
- WoRMS status and marine/extinction flags.
- Source endpoint and query definition.
- Source citation.
- Raw export checksum.
- Normalized catalog checksum.

The runtime bundles the normalized snapshot. It never depends on a live WoRMS
request.

## Authorization

Both entry points are guild-install and guild-context only. Invocation requires
at least one of these roles:

| Role | ID |
|---|---|
| Community Team | `1477360613125787678` |
| Maintainer | `1457214688806047756` |
| Maintainer Guest | `1503268035908075590` |

Target-response buttons are restricted to the named target. Holding an
authorized invocation role does not allow someone else to respond for the
target.

## Command Surface

### Slash Command

`/lobster user:<user>`

### User Command

`Release Lobster`

Both entry points create the same durable encounter and use the same
authorization, cooldown, selection, and rendering paths.

## Encounter Workflow

1. An authorized member selects a target.
2. Hermit verifies guild jurisdiction, authorization, and shared cooldowns.
3. Hermit deterministically selects one species uniformly from the frozen
   catalog.
4. Hermit selects one approved asset for that species without allowing species
   with larger art packs to become more likely.
5. Hermit derives the encounter copy, metrics, and available target responses
   from species metadata and the selected scene.
6. Hermit persists the complete encounter before publishing its canonical
   Carbon card.
7. Hermit binds the Discord message to the stored encounter.
8. The named target may choose one response.
9. Hermit records the first valid response atomically and updates the canonical
   card.

Interaction retries must reproduce the same species, scene, copy, and metrics.

## Target Responses

The initial release provides two mutually exclusive responses:

### Return To Sender

The selected lobster redirects the encounter toward the original actor. Hermit
records and renders a species-appropriate counter-event using a separately
selected approved asset.

### Offer Butter

The lobster accepts or rejects a negotiated release according to deterministic
species-specific copy. This response closes the encounter without a
counter-event.

Only one response may win. Repeated clicks are idempotent. Bots have response
controls disabled.

## Shared Cooldowns

`/slap` and `/lobster` use one shared action-cooldown ledger:

| Dimension | Duration |
|---|---:|
| Actor | 30 seconds |
| Target | 90 seconds |
| Channel | 12 seconds |

A successful `/slap` blocks `/lobster`, and a successful `/lobster` blocks
`/slap`, for every applicable dimension. Concurrent requests must resolve
atomically.

Target responses do not consume or reset invocation cooldowns.

## Species Metadata

Each catalog entry must include:

- AphiaID.
- Scientific and display names.
- Family and broad body plan.
- Habitat and depth band.
- Geographic region when known.
- Claw, antenna, tail, and body-form capabilities.
- Permitted action families.
- Prohibited anatomical actions.
- Narrative vocabulary.
- Approved scene identifiers.
- Accessibility description fragments.

Species metadata controls behavior. A species without large claws cannot be
rendered pinching a person.

## Artwork Model

### Coverage

- Every species receives at least four approved production scenes.
- Visually prominent or culturally familiar species may receive up to eight.
- The expected initial corpus is approximately 1,040 to 2,080 images.
- Species selection remains uniform regardless of art-pack size.

### Output Specification

- Format: WebP.
- Dimensions: exactly `768x512`.
- Aspect ratio: `3:2`.
- Color profile: sRGB.
- Metadata: stripped except required provenance metadata.
- Target average file size: 75 KB or less.
- Maximum file size: 120 KB.
- No readable text, brands, watermarks, or third-party characters.

### Visual Dimensions

Every asset manifest records:

- Species and family.
- Action.
- Environment.
- Historical or fictional era.
- Visual medium.
- Tone.
- Adult cast.
- Camera position and lens language.
- Composition.
- Lighting.
- Palette.
- Scene-family identifier.
- Generation prompt version.
- Human and automated review status.

### Required Visual Range

The corpus must deliberately cover:

- Naturalistic documentary photography.
- Cinematic action and comedy.
- Underwater and deep-sea horror.
- Film noir.
- Pulp adventure illustration.
- Gouache and watercolor illustration.
- Oil-painting tableaux.
- Inked comic panels without lettering.
- Cel animation.
- Stop-motion and miniature dioramas.
- Retro science fiction.
- Medieval and mythic fantasy.
- Fashion-editorial photography.
- Sports-broadcast imagery.
- Surreal collage.
- Vintage scientific-plate composition.

Settings must span natural habitats, beaches, reefs, ships, streets, transit,
markets, theaters, museums, arenas, castles, laboratories, festivals, deep-sea
vehicles, and fictional worlds. Offices and hearing rooms may appear only as a
small minority.

Adult human casts must vary gender presentation, skin tone, age, body type,
wardrobe, and role. Some scenes may feature robots, fantasy adults, or no humans
when the selected action remains legible.

### Diversity Quotas

- No visual medium exceeds 15% of the corpus.
- No environment family exceeds 10%.
- Office, boardroom, or hearing-room settings combined remain below 3%.
- No single cast pattern exceeds 5%.
- At least half of human scenes prominently include an adult woman.
- At least 20% of scenes use non-photorealistic media.
- At least 15% of scenes contain no conventional modern workplace.
- Consecutive assets for one species must differ in medium, environment,
  composition, and tone.
- Perceptual near-duplicates are rejected.

## Asset Storage

Production assets use a dedicated public Cloudflare R2 bucket and a production
custom domain.

Object keys are immutable and versioned:

`lobster/{snapshotId}/{aphiaId}/{sceneId}-{contentHash}.webp`

The repository stores:

- Taxonomy snapshots.
- Normalized catalog data.
- Scene manifests.
- Prompts and prompt versions.
- Checksums.
- Production asset URLs.
- Audit reports.

The repository does not store the full production image corpus.

## Discord Card

The canonical Carbon card includes:

- Encounter identifier.
- Scientific and display species names.
- Family.
- Artwork with meaningful alt text.
- Species-specific headline and narrative.
- Encounter metrics.
- Taxonomy snapshot identifier.
- Target-response status.
- `Return To Sender` and `Offer Butter` buttons when available.

No embed payloads or hand-built raw component objects are used.

## Data Requirements

Persist:

- Encounter ID and interaction ID.
- Guild, channel, and Discord message IDs.
- Actor and target IDs.
- Target bot status.
- Taxonomy snapshot ID.
- Species AphiaID, accepted name, display name, and family.
- Scene ID, immutable asset URL, and asset checksum.
- Narrative, headline, metrics, and accessibility description.
- Response type, response actor, response timestamp, and response result.
- Counter-event fields when applicable.
- Creation and message-binding timestamps.

Historical events must remain renderable after taxonomy or artwork refreshes.

## Integrity And Failure Handling

- Interaction retries reuse the persisted encounter.
- Component actions must match the stored guild, channel, message, target, and
  encounter identifiers.
- Only one target response may be recorded.
- Missing catalog or artwork entries fail privately before publishing.
- Failed Discord publication does not create an unbound reusable event.
- Failed card synchronization is logged and can be retried idempotently.
- A taxonomy refresh never mutates historical encounter records.

## Observability

Structured logs include:

- Encounter ID.
- Interaction ID.
- Snapshot ID.
- AphiaID and family.
- Scene ID.
- Actor, target, and channel cooldown decisions.
- Message-binding result.
- Target-response transition.
- Discord response status.

Prompts and private runtime credentials must not be logged.

## Validation

Automated validation must prove:

- Every included species has exactly one catalog record.
- Every species has at least four approved assets.
- Every asset URL is immutable and reachable.
- Every image is valid WebP at exactly `768x512`.
- Every image is at or below 120 KB.
- Checksums match the production objects.
- Species never use prohibited anatomical actions.
- Diversity quotas pass.
- Perceptual duplicate thresholds pass.
- Alt text exists for every scene.
- Shared cooldowns work in both command directions.
- Concurrent response attempts produce one terminal result.
- Unauthorized invocations and responses are rejected privately.
- `bun test`, `bun run typecheck`, and `bun run deploy:dry-run` pass.

## Release Gates

Implementation may begin only after:

1. All 327 slap scenes have been regenerated and replaced.
2. Every slap scene is exactly `768x512`.
3. The slap diversity and file-size audits pass.
4. The replacement slap corpus is visually reviewed.
5. The slap cache-busting change is deployed.
6. Cloudflare's configured production build and CodeQL pass.
7. The user approves the remediated slap experience.

Production release additionally requires:

1. Approved taxonomy parent scope and snapshot.
2. Dedicated R2 bucket and custom domain.
3. Complete species and artwork coverage.
4. Anatomy and diversity review sign-off.
5. A successful upload-and-retrieval audit of at least 1,000 objects.
6. Discord staging smoke tests for command, counter, response, cooldown, and
   retry behavior.

## Product Decisions

| ID | Status | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| LOB-1 | Confirmed | The final artwork size is `768x512` WebP |
| LOB-2 | Confirmed | Every accepted extant marine species in the six approved families is represented |
| LOB-3 | Confirmed | Artwork is species-specific rather than a universal outcome matrix |
| LOB-4 | Confirmed | Slap artwork remediation blocks lobster implementation |
| LOB-5 | Proposed | Each species receives four to eight production scenes |
| LOB-6 | Proposed | Invocation uses the same three authorized roles as `/slap` |
| LOB-7 | Proposed | `/slap` and `/lobster` share cooldowns |
| LOB-8 | Proposed | Production artwork is stored in a dedicated public R2 bucket |
| LOB-9 | Proposed | Target responses are `Return To Sender` and `Offer Butter` |

## Open Questions

1. Who owns scientific anatomy review and final art approval?
2. What snapshot refresh cadence should be used after v1?
3. What bucket and custom-domain names should be provisioned?
4. Should Hermit, Rock Lobster, bots, and self-targets receive dedicated
   species-specific scenes in v1?
5. Should `Return To Sender` select a second species or reuse the original
   species?
6. Should rare species receive equal selection probability or a separately
   approved rarity model after v1?
